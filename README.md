# Graph editor with SVG

https://graph-editor-svg.netlify.app

This is kind of version 2.0 of [my previous graph editor](https://github.com/ScriptRaccoon/graph-editor) made with Svelte. The difference is that here we don't use divs but SVGs for the nodes and lines instead - so the graph is easy to export as well. Also, there are no menus, so everything is controlled with mouse and keyboard.
